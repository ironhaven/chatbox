To open a can of tuna, first locate the pull-tab on the lid. If there's no pull-tab, you'll need a can opener. For a pull-tab can, simply lift the tab gently until it breaks the seal, then pull it back and around the rim of the can. Be careful of sharp edges. If using a can opener, place the can opener on the rim of the can and rotate the handle until the lid is completely cut, then carefully remove the lid.
